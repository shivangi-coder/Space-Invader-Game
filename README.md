# Space-Invader-Game
Hi I made this project using Kaboom.js with the guidance of <b> freecodecamp
</b>.
The instructor during the session was Ania Kubow. I got to
learn a lot while making this project and it was an amazing experience learning with freecodecamp.
<br><br>Here's the link for you to watch the sessions as well<br>

<br>I got to have hands on experience on:
<li>HTML
<li>Javascript
<li>Kaboom.js
<br>while coding the project, and everything was explained from the very basics so that
anyone with zero experience on programming can learn.
I enjoyed making this game, you can as well.
